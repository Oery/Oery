*Building software that makes gaming and content creation more enjoyable*

##

Hey I'm 𝓞𝓔𝓡𝓨. 

## What do I believe in ?

### FOSS

Free and open-source software gave birth to the most impressive pieces of code I've used.
To give back to the system I love, I try contributing as much as possible to the open source community.

### Digital Freedom


### Good Software

In parallel of building software, I'm also pushing my limits through challenges. Those challenges changed the way I think, the way I learn and most importantly the way I work. Challenging myself helps me to build up discipline and determination

## 🚀 Some projects I'm building

### 🪞 Kagami
A TCP proxy that allows devs to add features to Minecraft through packets.
Kagami can modify, filter, and inject packets into the TCP traffic using user defined closures.
The crate has a focus on DX, packets are fully typesafe and abstract all the serializing so devs can work with the interface they expect.
It includes its own implementation of the Minecraft protocol.
create a bridge between Minecraft and their application.

### ⚔️ Godhome Elo Counter
A Hollow Knight mod that brings an ELO rating system to Godhome. It let players improve their consistency through statistics.

### 🌊 Flow
A desktop app that contains a bunch of automations for Minecraft streamers. Flow can detect which Minecraft client they're using, track what resource packs they're using, what server they're playing on, etc... Then Flow will update bot commands on the streamer livestream so they will always be up to date. To my knowledge, Flow is the only software that does this. Small creators will struggle to keep commands up to date. Bigger creators will simply use the power of slavery (unpaid moderators) to do it for them. Flow can lower the gap between both while improve the viewer experience for both. It also contains an automatic queuing scene to protect streamers against stream sniping. Flow can integrate with OBS, NightBot, Wizebot, and Twitch. It's also highly customizable so it can adapt to the streamer.

## 💻 Tech Stack

Rust is currently my main technology, I simply love how easy it can be to build performant and strict software. TypeScript is close behind as I use it a lot for UI and web applications. Outside of those two, I learn a language based on the project I need it for (eg C# for HK mods, Java for MC mods).
