# > Hey_

I'm *Oery*, a self teaching dev with a passion for learning. I'm currently interested in low level programming.

### Active Projects
- [Origami](https://www.github.com/oery/origami) : a library for building Minecraft bots in Rust
- [Kagami](https://www.github.com/oery/kagami) : a framework for building client side Minecraft plugins in Rust

Both of those projects uses [Gami_MC_Protocol](https://www.github.com/oery/gami_mc_protocol), my rust-based implementation of the Minecraft Network protocol.
