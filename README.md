## What I believe in

### 🌍 FOSS

Free and open-source software gave birth to the most impressive pieces of code I've used.
To give back to the system I love, I try contributing as much as possible to the open source community.

### 🔓 Digital Freedom
I believe in breaking free from the confines of big corporations.
True digital freedom means owning the tools you use, gaining the power to customize, and shaping the digital world to your needs. My work is a step toward enabling everyone to take control of their digital experiences and redefine how they interact with technology.

### 💎 Good Software

In parallel of building software, I'm also pushing my limits through challenges. Those challenges changed the way I think, the way I learn and most importantly the way I work. Challenging myself helps me to build up discipline and determination

## 🚀 Some projects I'm building

### 🪞 Kagami
A developer-first client side TCP proxy for Minecraft.
Kagami empowers developers to expand Minecraft with custom features via packet manipulation.

- Modify, filter, or inject packets into TCP traffic with ease.
- Fully type-safe packets for an intuitive developer experience.
- Built-in Minecraft protocol implementation.

Kagami bridges the gap between Minecraft closed clients and external applications.

### ⚔️ Godhome Elo Counter
A Hollow Knight mod that introduces an ELO rating system for Godhome.

- Tracks player consistency with detailed statistics.
- Helps players refine their skills and achieve mastery.

### 🌊 Flow
The ultimate automation tool for Minecraft streamers.
Flow integrates with popular streaming tools to give content creators a seamless experience:

- Automatically updates bot commands to match the streamer’s Minecraft client, resource packs, server, and more.
- Protects streamers with anti-stream-sniping features like automated queueing scenes.
- Integrates with OBS, NightBot, Wizebot, and Twitch.

Flow bridges the gap for small creators who can’t rely on moderators while enhancing viewer experience for everyone.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Rust**: My primary language for building performant and reliable software.
- **TypeScript**: My go-to for crafting intuitive and robust UIs.
- **C# & Java**: Learned and applied specifically for modding projects like Hollow Knight and Minecraft.
- **Polyglot Mindset**: I adapt to the language and tools that best fit the project at hand.
