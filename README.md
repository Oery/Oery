## My Projects

Hey, I'm a SWE student with a passion for learning. When I'm not trying to beat a stupidly difficult challenge, I'm working on a stupidly hard coding project.

Most of my projects are built in Rust.

### ðŸ§Š Gami Minecraft Protocol
My implementation of the Minecraft protocol in Rust.
It includes a packet serializer/deserializer, easy to use structs that abstracts all encoding constraints and IDs through enum registries.

### ðŸªž Kagami
A Minecraft client-side TCP proxy that allows devs to create plugins and interact with the client without requiring any modification. It provides a simple event system and API to inject/edit packets.

### ðŸ¦¢ Origami

A programmable Minecraft client that can be used to create AIs / Bots / Agents.
It focuses on performances and accuracy, trying to mimick a real client as closely as possible while maintaining low cpu and memory usage in scenarios where many bots run concurrently.

## My End Goal

My work aims to solve the many challenges this game faced during its golden age, slowly killing minigames servers and competitive Minecraft.
