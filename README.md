## Welcome

Hey, I'm a SWE student with a focus on high performance applications.

My latest projects feature:
- **Kagami**: A Minecraft TCP proxy with packet injection abilities
- **Kyoko**: A Minecraft packet debugger made using Kagami
- **GodHome ELO Counter**: A Hollow Knight mod that let players use an ELO system to practice consistency
