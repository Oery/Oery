## 🚀 Some projects I'm building

### 🪞 Kagami
A developer-first client side TCP proxy for Minecraft.
Kagami empowers developers to expand Minecraft with custom features via packet manipulation.

- Modify, filter, or inject packets into TCP traffic with ease.
- Fully type-safe packets for an intuitive developer experience.
- Built-in Minecraft protocol implementation.

Kagami bridges the gap between Minecraft closed clients and external applications.

### ⚔️ Godhome Elo Counter
A Hollow Knight mod that introduces an ELO rating system for Godhome.

- Tracks player consistency with detailed statistics.
- Helps players refine their skills and achieve mastery.

### 🌊 Flow
The ultimate automation tool for Minecraft streamers.
Flow integrates with popular streaming tools to give content creators a seamless experience:

- Automatically updates bot commands to match the streamer’s Minecraft client, resource packs, server, and more.
- Protects streamers with anti-stream-sniping features like automated queueing scenes.
- Integrates with OBS, NightBot, Wizebot, and Twitch.

Flow bridges the gap for small creators who can’t rely on moderators while enhancing viewer experience for everyone.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Rust**: My primary language for building performant and reliable software.
- **TypeScript**: My go-to for crafting intuitive and robust UIs.
- **C# & Java**: Learned and applied specifically for modding projects like Hollow Knight and Minecraft.
