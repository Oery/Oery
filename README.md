# Hey

I'm *Oery*, a self teaching dev with a passion for learning. I'm currently interested in low level programming.

### Active Projects
- [Origami](www.github.com/oery/origami) : a Minecraft Bot Client library (from scratch)
- [Kagami](www.github.com/oery/kagami) : a framework for building client side Minecraft plugins

Both of those projects uses [Gami_MC_Protocol](www.github.com/oery/gami_mc_protocol), my rust-based implementation of the Minecraft Network protocol.
